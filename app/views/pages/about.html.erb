        <p>I'm James Simshaw, a software engineer with experience primarily in Java, Android, Ruby, Python, and C.  I have degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics from Oregon State University.  Not only do I love writing code, but solving problems as well.  The greatest problems to solve are those that the solution helps to improve the lives of as many people as possible.</p>
